# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Guide for Medical Report Simplifier

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Ensure you have these files in your repo:
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration  
- `Procfile` - Alternative start command
- `app/main.py` - Your FastAPI application

### 2. Deploy to Railway

1. **Sign up/Login to Railway**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your medical-report-simplifier repository
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Python project

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In your Railway project dashboard
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Add these environment variables:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   AI_TEMPERATURE=0.3
   VALIDATION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7
   MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically start building and deploying
   - Build process installs Python dependencies and system packages
   - Tesseract OCR is automatically included in Railway's environment

### 3. Access Your Deployed API

After successful deployment:
- **API URL**: `https://your-project-name.railway.app`
- **API Documentation**: `https://your-project-name.railway.app/docs`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-project-name.railway.app/api/v1/health`

### 4. Test Your Deployed API

```bash
# Replace with your actual Railway URL
export API_URL="https://your-project-name.railway.app"

# Test health check
curl $API_URL/api/v1/health

# Test text processing
curl -X POST "$API_URL/api/v1/process-text" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "CBC: Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL (Low), WBC 11,200 /uL (High)"}'

# Test demo format  
curl -X POST "$API_URL/api/v1/demo-problem-statement" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "CBC: Hemglobin 10.2 g/dL (Low), WBC 11,200 /uL (Hgh)"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails - Missing Dependencies**
   - Check `requirements.txt` has all packages
   - Ensure versions are compatible

2. **Runtime Error - Tesseract Not Found**
   - Railway includes Tesseract by default
   - If issues persist, add to `railway.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "build": {
       "builder": "NIXPACKS",
       "buildCommand": "apt-get update && apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Double-check variable names match your code
   - Restart deployment after adding variables

4. **Port Issues**
   - Ensure you use `$PORT` environment variable
   - Railway automatically assigns the port

### Viewing Logs

In Railway dashboard:
- Go to "Logs" tab to see build and runtime logs
- Check for any error messages during startup

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Railway dashboard, go to "Settings"
2. Under "Domains", click "Generate Domain" or add custom domain
3. Railway provides HTTPS automatically

## Production Checklist

Before going live:
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] API endpoints tested
- [ ] Error handling verified
- [ ] Rate limiting considered
- [ ] Monitoring setup (Railway provides basic metrics)
- [ ] Backup API key stored securely

## Monitoring & Maintenance

Railway provides:
- **Automatic deployments** on git push
- **Basic metrics** (CPU, memory, requests)
- **Log aggregation**
- **Automatic HTTPS**
- **Custom domain support**

For production use, consider:
- Setting up proper monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
- Implementing rate limiting
- Adding request logging
- Setting up health check alerts

## Alternative Deployment Options

If Railway doesn't work for you:

### Render
1. Connect GitHub repo to Render
2. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set start command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

### Heroku
1. Add tesseract buildpack: `heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku-community/apt`
2. Create `Aptfile`: `tesseract-ocr`
3. Deploy with Procfile

### DigitalOcean App Platform
1. Connect GitHub repo
2. Auto-detects Python app
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy

Choose Railway for the easiest setup with automatic OCR support!
